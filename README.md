# MF810Project

Background
The final project is for you to demonstrate your ability to handle reasonably large data sets in the pursuit of answering questions related to financial problems. Leveraging the tools and skills that you learn in this half of the course, including tidy data concepts and grammar for data manipulation, your task is to form a small group (max at 2 people) and select an interesting question regarding financial markets.

Task
Select a set of questions on a topic. Search for a dataset or multiple datasets (ideally in aggregate >10 gigabytes) that can help you garner insight into your question. Write code that (a) showcases your ability to proficiently manipulate data and (b) arrives at an answer for the set of questions that you have selected.

Ideas for questions
• Analysis of consumer demand
• Mortgage delinquency roll rate analysis
• Loan delinquency prediction
• Impact of COVID-19 on supply chain
• Patent as an intangible asset of companies
• Vessel traffic through Suez Canal
• Social media coverage of companies
• Add-on question to existing research you are conducting
